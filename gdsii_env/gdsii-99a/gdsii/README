Matlab / Octave Function Library for GDS II Stream Format
=========================================================

This software is in the Public Domain, with the exception
of the files 'datamatrixmex.c', 'gdsii_excess64dec.c',
and the functions for Boolean set operations.

New versions of the toolbox can be downloaded from:

https://sites.google.com/site/ulfgri/numerical/gdsii-toolbox

These functions are particularly useful when a layout is the result 
of a computation. Matlab / Octave can then be used as a macro language
for writing the layout. 


Functions
=========
Toolbox functions are grouped into the following directories:

Basic:
    Contains the low level functions for reading and writing
    of files in GDS II stream format and defines objects and
    methods for working with GDS II layouts.

Elements:
    Contains functions that return gds_element objects.

Structures:
    Contains functions that return gds_structure objects

Boolean: 
    The GDS II toolbox contains a method that performs boolean
    set operations on boundary elements. This is described in more
    detail in the file: README-Boolean / README-Boolean.pdf

Misc:
    Functions that don't return gds_* objects.
    
Scripts:
    Command line scripts for Octave that can be run directly
    from the shell prompt in a Linux / Unix environment.


Compiling
=========
This software contains several MEX functions, which must be 
compiled with a C compiler (and a C++ compiler in one case), 
before the library can be used. In Octave, this is done by
executing the 

./makemex-octave

script at the shell prompt. In MATLAB the mex functions can be
compiled by changing to the ./gdsii directory and running

>> makemex

at the MATLAB command prompt.

NOTE:
The LCC compiler that was included with some versions of MATLAB is
not able to compile the Clipper library, which is written in C++.
If no good C compiler is available, the General Polygon Clipper
library must be used instead of the Clipper library for Boolean set
operations (but check the license ...). The toolbox must then be 
compiled with the 

>> makemex_gpc

script.
