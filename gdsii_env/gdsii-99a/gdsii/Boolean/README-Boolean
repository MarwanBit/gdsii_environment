Boolean Set Operations for the GDS II Octave / MATLAB Toolbox
=============================================================

Beginning with version 86 the GDS II toolbox provides a method
'poly_bool' in the gds_element class that performs Boolean set
operations on GDS boundary elements. This function makes use of the
Clipper library by Angus Johnson (www.angusj.com) or the General
Polygon Clipper library (GPC) by Alan Murta
(http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/gpc/). Either of these open source
libraries can be used by compiling an appropriate mex function
interface. The Clipper libary can be used in commercial and
non-commercial settings and it is also faster than the GPC library.
Clipper is, however, written in C++ and cannot be compiled with the
LCC C compiler that is included with MATLAB on Windows 32 up to R2011b
(?). When only LCC is available, the GPC library must be used instead
of the Clipper library. 

The mex interface function for one of the polygon algebra libraries
must be compiled to make the functionality available to the GDS II
toolbox. Change to either the Boolean/gpc or the Boolean/clipper
directory and type

makemex

at the MATLAB prompt. The same works in Octave, but the shell script

./makemex-octave

can also be run to compile the mex functions. Only one of the mex
functions should be compiled to make sure that MATLAB or Octave load
the correct function.
